** DONE [#A] Command-line options don't always override init-file options
   - State "DONE"       [2009-01-21 Wed 18:53] \\
     Fixed by changing the order in which options are read:
     
       1. Global defaults
       2. Environment variable settings
       3. Initialization file
       4. Command-line arguments
     
     Whatever is later in the list overrides what is earlier.

** DONE [#A] Reading Ledger data from stdin does not work at all
   - State "DONE"       [2009-01-21 Wed 18:26] \\
     Fixed by buffering stdin data into memory before parsing it.

** DONE %2.2X format string doesn't work
   - State "DONE"       [2009-01-20 Tue 21:02] \\
     Fixed in 2.6.2.
   If I use %2.2X in a format string, I would expect to either get the string
   "! ", the string "* " or " ", but for the non-cleared case, it doesn't print
   any spaces, and the columns don't line up.  Other optional formatting (such
   as %C) seem to work with width indicators.

   I've worked around this by putting the %X as the last thing in the register,
   but it would be nice to be able to see it next to the amounts.

** DONE When --no-cache is used, a file named '<none>' is being written out
   - State "DONE"       [2009-01-20 Tue 21:02] \\
     Fixed in 2.6.2.
   I'm running off of the v2.6.1 tag in git.  I occasionally find that the
   ledger cache has a few problems, usually causing posts to have the
   wrong sign.  I haven't figured out exactly how to reproduce this.
   
   I've put --no-cache in my ~/.ledgerrc, but this seems to just cause it to
   write the cache to a file in the current directory called "<none>".  I'm not
   sure if it reads the file or not.
