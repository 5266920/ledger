** DONE [[bug:350][#350]] --gain shows wrong resuls
   - Note taken on [2010-06-20 Sun 17:48] \\
     Another possibility is that name-merging unless fixated and non-fixated
     versions both exist, in which case name merging is only done for the
     non-fixated, and all of the fixated will have their prices reported as if
     --lot-prices had been specified just for them.
   - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2010-06-20 Sun 17:20] \\
   I've fixed the problem as you presented it, but there is more going on
   here.  Most importantly, commodities with fixated prices are logically
   distinct from those without.  Here's what happens:
   
   On 2008-01-01, you buy 5 shares of GBP at a unit-price of 1.4 EUR.
   Internally, this commodity is named GBP {1.4 EUR}.  If ever the share price
   of GBP changes, the offset from 1.4 EUR will represent a gain or loss.
   
   On 2009-01-01, you "sold" 5 shares of GBP {=1.4 EUR} for 7.50 EUR, making
   0.50 EUR in the process.  Ledger does not ask whether you owned these
   shares before selling them, as double-entry accounting does not require
   this foreknowledge.  My bug fix today was to make sure that a sale of a
   fixated commodity does not record a market price for other commodities of
   the same basename.
   
   If, later, the value of GBP should change, there will still be a gain
   reflected, as you have not yet sold the 5 shares of GBP {1.4 EUR}.  Again,
   GBP {=1.4 EUR} != GBP {1.4 EUR}.  You may have converted 5 shares of GBP
   {=1.4 EUR}, but in Ledger's eyes, internally, you still own 5 shares of GBP
   {1.4 EUR}.  If GBP should ever get revalued, this will show up as a
   gain/loss in the --gain report.
   
   What makes all of this confusing is that by default, Ledger 'collapses'
   commodities which are related by name as if they were the same commodity.
   This is a convenience, since until now no one has ever thought to mix
   fixated and non-fixated versions of the same commodity.  Thus, Ledger
   *reports* GBP {1.4 EUR} and GBP {=1.4 EUR} as if they were both GBP, but
   for calculating the --gain report, it will reckon them as separate.
   
   This all becomes much clearer if you use "reg --lot-prices", to stop Ledger
   from merging like-named commodities.
   
   I'm not sure there is an answer here, other than forcing fixated commodities
   to always display with their fixated price -- though I'm not sure most people
   would want that.  The only other answer is to not mix them, or to think very
   hard in the case where you do and still want meaning from --gain.

   It will show two budget transactions:

   But if the rent transaction (last one in the file) is removed, it no
   longer generates any housecleaning budget transactions for that month:
   :OUTPUT:

   It should be generating the budget entries at the end, even though
   there is no final transaction to "kick" the budget filter.

    - State "DEFERRED"   from "TODO"       [2010-06-02 Wed 01:41] \\
      You are right, --percent cannot handle multiple commodities.  And since
      --exchange always takes place after --percent, it's not as
      straightforward as it seems.  I'm going to defer this bug until after
      3.0, since it may not be worth fixing.  But I'll keep thinking on it.
    I've found that --percent option is incompatible with --exchange.  Well,
    actually I suspect that --percent is not able to handle multi currencies.

    In the following simple exemple, I would have expected that --percent
    option works correctly.

     solves most of these issues.
     
     However, would it be possible to add a date for C?  I'd like to see ATS
     before 2002-01-01 and EUR from then on.
   There are a couple of problems with ledger when using currencies that were
   replaced by the Euro as well as the Euro.
   
   First, I know that ledger is mostly designed as a "calculator" without any
   knowledge about the actual input.  However, given that some currencies
   were replaced by the Euro and have fixed exchange rates that will not
   change, it would be nice if ledger would know about those.  How about
   adding a text file to ledger that is read by default with such fixed
   conversion rates?  (If you agree, I'm happy to write one for the
   currencies replaced by the Euro.)
   
   Related to this is a problem with showing currencies.  Let's say that I
   have accounts with ATS, EUR and GBP.  How can I tell ledger to convert ATS
   to EUR but do no other conversation.  -X EUR won't work because it would
   also convert GBP, but I want to see both EUR and GBP (I just want the
   obsolete ATS to be converted to EUR).  Is this possible somehow?
   
   Finally, there appear to be some artefacts because ledger doesn't know
   that ATS is a currency replaced by EUR.  Normally, "ledger bal" does not
   display accounts that are empty (see the first example below).  But if I
   put something into an account as ATS and then take out exactly the same
   amount (but as EUR), "ledger bal" will show the account name and "0"
   (probably because it switches to commodity mode).
   
   Example:
   
   a)
#+begin_src sh
   2010-04-02 Test
      A:Foo  10.00
      A:Bar
   
   2010-04-02 Test
      A:Foo  -10.00
      A:Baz
#+end_src
   
   b)
#+begin_src sh
   P 2001-12-31 EUR 13.7603 ATS
   
   2001-01-01 Test
      B:Foo  13.7603 ATS
      B:Bar
   
   2010-04-02 Test
      B:Foo  -1.00 EUR
      B:Baz
#+end_src
   
   a) will show no Foo with "ledger bal" but b) will show "0 Foo".

   Use the following ledger data

   With -X, you currently can only say "convert everything to one commodity"

   My scenario: I have lived both in Autria (a EUR country) and the UK (which
   has GPB).  So right now I have accounts in EUR and GBP and then I also have
   some random money from travel (USD, TWD, etc) floating around as well as
   some shares.
   
   I'd like to be able to say: convert everything _but_ GBP to EUR (or GBP).
   This is what I'd like to see most of the time... just those two currencies.
   But sometimes I want to convert _everything_ (including GBP) to EUR.
   
   I like the "primary COMM ACCOUNT" syntax you propose in #217 but to achieve
   what I want I think we need an option --convert-primary or so.  Then I
   could say:
#+begin_src sh
    -X EUR,GBP

** TODO [#C] [[bug:232][#232]] Support variant behaviors for -V
   The problem is: for a given amount of a commodity, which commodity should
   its value be reported in terms of?

   1. For a transaction, an amount of the commodity might be permanently
      associated with another commodity.  This is a "price value".
   2. For a certain commodity, another commodity may always be the pricing
      commodity.  This is a "commodity value".
   3. For a certain account, a specific commodity may always be used for
      pricing.  This is an "account value".
   4. For a certain report, the user may request valuation using a list of
      candidate commodities.  This is a "report value".
   5. Otherwise, the user may desire simply the most recent valuation
      possible.  This is a "market value".

   So the target commodity might be bound to: a particular amount, a
   commodity, or an account.  If it's not bound during parsing, it may be
   bound during reporting using -X to specify a commodity.  If it's not bound
   at all, then it is valued using the most recent prices available, no matter
   their commodity.

   Then here is the logic:

   1.  If --exchange-only is specified, use those commodities.
   2.  Else if a commodity has been FIXED to the amount, use that.
   3.  Else if a commodity has been FIXED to the account, use that.
   4.  Else if a commodity has been FIXED to the commodity, use that.
   5.  Else if the amount's commodity is itself primary, use that.
   6.  Else if -X is specified, use those commodities.
   7.  Else if the amount has a price/cost, use the price's commodity.
   8.  Else if the account balance contains primary commodities, use
       whichever has the highest absolute value.
   9.  Else if the commodity has a history of association with other
       commodities, use whichever is most frequent.
   10. Else use whichever commodity yields the most recent market value.

   - State "DEFERRED"   from "TODO"       [2009-10-25 Sun 22:06]
   I had another idea: do you remember I mentioned a problem I had, which that
   some of my trade confirmation slips provide the "adjusted cost base" and not
   the cost-per-share? This makes it a big ugly to enter such postings, even
   with expressions:
   :DATA:
     BrokerAccount    -29.435 WIDGETS {353.51435/29.435 USD} @ 13.02 USD
   :END:
   (I didn't test the above, by the way, that was your suggestion when we
   talked last time.)

   I propose this syntax:
   :DATA:
     BrokerAccount    -29.435 WIDGETS {{353.51435 USD}} @ 13.02 USD
   :END:
   It's a bit similar to the idea of @ vs. @@ where the single char (@) is for
   price, and the double (@@) is for total amount. Using {{ ... }} refers to
   the total cost, while { ... } refers to the cost price (per share).

   This is the e-mail I was drafting for the mailing list, in response to
   [[message://770306.78630.qm@web111402.mail.gq1.yahoo.com][Re: {boost} Boost.Python question about converters and make_getter]]:

   Just one quick question:

   I have a Boost.Python method that looks like this:

     .def("__iter__", range<return_value_policy<return_by_value> >
	  (py_pool_commodities_begin, py_pool_commodities_end))

   Where the members of the map are std::pair<string, MyObject *>.  I want the
   pair passed by value, but I need the "second" member to be accessed using
   reference_existing_object.

   - State "DEFERRED"   from "TODO"       [2009-10-25 Sun 22:04]
   Is there a way to let ledger output its reports showing the accounts in the
   more conventional way as debit and credit accounts, instead of having a
   positive or negative saldo?
 
   Here is one example:
   :OUTPUT:
Assets:Bank
Tr.#	date		Text			debit		credit		saldo
1	2008-01-01	Mr. Sponsor		500				500
2	2008-01-02	Bill					100		400

Income:Donations
Tr.#	date		Text			debit		credit		saldo
1	2008-01-01	Mr. Sponsor				500		-500

Expenses:Electricity
Tr.#	date		Text			debit		credit		saldo
2	2008-01-02	Bill			100				100
   :END:
   There should be a way of distinguishing between debit accounts, as assets
   and expenses, and credit accounts, as Income and liabilities. It is of
   course possible to processs ledger's output to achieve this, but it would be
   nice if it could be done in ledger directly.

*** Boost
    The build is huge, so I'd have to pick out only the parts you actually
    need which is quite involved. You should be able to get it to work with
    the binary installers from http://www.boostpro.com/download . I build from
    source at work because I need to set some compiler flags (disable checked
    iterators) but that's not necessary for ledger's case. I'm not sure where
    the installer puts its files, I presume program files/boost or
    something. There will probably be a directory called 'lib' or 'libs' or
    something. You go to Tools -> Options -> Projects and Solutions -> VC++
    Directories and select 'Library files' in the top right corner. In that
    list you add a new directory, the one where the boost installer's library
    files are in. If you select 'Include files' in that drop down box, you can
    immediately set the path to the boost headers, too. These options can also
    be set on the project level but since they'll be different on different
    machines I prefer to put them in global settings and document them in the
    build procedure.

   - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2010-06-15 Tue 05:24]
   1. Some compiler warnings. There are a number of contructs where VS is more
      fussy about than gcc. I have disabled these specific warnings, which I
      think is fine, especially for the ones where there is no direct Unix
      equivalent.
      - Warning: force int to bool, performance penalty. In many places in the
        code, ints and bools are directly compared or used in single
        expressions which apparently can (or could in the past) cause a
        performance degradation as it would require a few more instructions to
        do the comparison with an int. I think it's safe to ignore this
        warning; I've disabled it in the project files.
      - Unused variables. Mostly in catch() blocks, the 'err' variable is
        hardly ever used. Can ignore this too, I think.
      - Mixing of struct and class. In many places, forward declarations
        happen as class while the actual declaration is as struct. Only
        difference is the default visibility; if I change everything to be
        'class' I get errors on accessing private members. I'm not sure if the
        standard prescribes what should happen in this case, I've just changed
        everything to 'struct' and now it compiles fine. This is mostly a
        stylistic issue, I'll leave that to you to decide.
      - str_xxx functions. Those are deprecated in VS because they're
        potentially unsafe; replacements with a _s suffix are provided. Since
        those are not portable I suggest we ignore these warnings; I've
        disabled them in the project properties.
      - Cast from uint_least32_t for SHA1::Result. In 2 or 3 places (in
        utils.cc, filters.cc, utils.h) I had to add a cast to uint* like this:
        #+begin_src c++
        sha.Result((unsigned int*)message_digest);
        #+end_src
        Is this ok? I'm not quite sure why uint_least32_t[] was used here in
        the first place?
   2. Missing preprocessor defines. The code uses PACKAGE_VERSION and VERSION
      precompiler constants. Can you explain where they come from?  (I mean I
      guess they come from the build chain, but where are their values taken
      from?) For now I've manually set them to 'next' in the project
      configuration but I guess they should automatically use the correct one.
   3. Another minor stylistic issue is the mixing of tabs and spaces. The code
      is quite hard to read in some places because the spaces seem to assume
      an indent of 2, but the tab width is set to 4 (by default) on VS. I
      don't know anyone who ever changes it either. So this is really minor
      but it would be nice if all tabs could be replaced with 2 spaces, or
      tabs would be used consistently.
   4. Now we get to the real problems. There are a few places where real
      Unix constructs are used that have no equivalent in Wnidows.
      - In visit_man_page, fork() is used. It looks like this is only for
        showing the man page though. I suggest an #ifdef where the Windows
        version opens a browser with the documentation, considering there is
        no such thing as man on Windows.
      - stream.cc uses pipes and forks for the 'pager' functionality.  Could
        you explain what this does? Is this required on Windows? I've
        commented it out for now.
      - main.cc sets a handler for the SIGPIPE signal which doesn't exist on
        Windows. I've put that in a #ifdef _WIN32 section, seems the
        reasonable thing to do.
   5. Python integration. The py_ files don't seem to have a way to be
      disabled through the preprocessor; I guess the Unix build chain compiles
      them or not based on the ./configure options. I have left them out of
      the project for now. It's been a long time since I embedded Python
      somewhere, I'd have to look into this a bit deeper.
   6. amount.cc uses mpfr_asprintf . I got an error from the linker that the
      implementation of this was not found. I can't find it in my mpfr sources
      either. I've replaced it with gmp_asprintf and now it compiles and links
      fine. I'm not familiar with all of these libraries, is this the same
      function with a different name? Did I screw something up in configuring
      mpfr?
   7. Lastly, I haven't run the tests yet. The program itself compiles and
      runs fine (ledger --help, that is - haven't tried any real
      functionality) but the next step would be for me to test if all
      functionality works as expected. I see a bunch of python and c++ code in
      the test directory; do I need python to run any tests at all or can I
      skip those and focus on the cpp tests first?

** TODO [#C] [[bug:341][#341]] Document suggestions from Russell
   - I was completely unaware of ti and to --- nice little toy; a man page
     comes to mind

   - Could you add to the front cover page a 'last added to' datemark that
     persists and is not auto-updated, si I can print and carry stuff around;
     also it is missing a formal 'Copyright' and license summary page

     It lays out OK for lulu to print it, in terms of production of the PDF
     being 'press ready':
     http://www.lulu.com/content/paperback-book/ledger-wip-doco/8971830

   - The document 'just ends'; an index end section, and possibly an Appendix
     to collate definitions would provide a more graceful ending

     I would 'wordsmith' to the effect that a Journal of transactions is more
     important than a ledger, as one is the document of entry (not original
     entry, as there are receipts, etc, before transactions get journalized)
     and the other is a more RO collation and organization of the journalled
     data

     A sample dataset, particularly showing off the gnuplot hook, and
     cascading into the doco PDF would be cool

   - I dont see any Python example code installed in the site-local -- did I
     mess up?  Also I think splitting the headers out to a -devel sub-package
     looks like a good idea. Looking, I see no Versioned .so names and a link
     to an API level?  I need to locate and add the sample scripts refereeced

     /usr/share/doc/ledger-0.0.20100615.git/doc/.dirstamp looks like it should
     go and not be installed by me

** TODO [#C] [[bug:329][#329]] Suggestions for improving the documentation
   - I think it's great that there is such an elaborate manual, but the
     structure is a bit unintuitive to learn from. May I suggest to move the
     'keeping a ledger' section to the beginning, before 'running ledger'. Or
     maybe shrink 'running ledger' to one page with the general explanation,
     and move the details to the back in a 'command line options reference'
     section. I understand that it's hard to combine a tutorial style manual
     and a reference manual in one document; I have the same problem when
     documenting my software. Having tutorial style in the front and reference
     in the back seems to work OK for me, without requiring two document with
     the problems that brings.
   - Some real-world examples of complete commands, as collected from the
     collective of ledger users, would be nice. Maybe this could be put in a
     'tick and tricks' section.
   - In this section, it would be nice if there was a section on Windows that
     explains that the Windows cmd.exe can't show € symbols. That one cost me
     20 minutes to figure out, after which I had to switch to EUR.
   - It would also be nice if this section had a table with the names of
     assests, equity, debts etc. in various languages/locales. At least a part
     of ledger users don't have background in accounting I think, and as for
     myself, despite having taken several accountancy/finance classes I still
     need to look up the terms each time because I don't use them every day. I
     would like to use the English terms but this is not feasible because I
     may need to communicate my numbers with the local tax office, tax
     advisors etc. later on, and they all only know and use the local
     terms.
   - Next step will be for me to document everything that is necessary to
     build ledger: getting and building libraries, getting and building boost,
     setting config options etc. It's rather challenging I image for anyone
     who doesn't do this every day.
   - The biggest issue I've run into is that syntax section isn't quite
     complete.  In the copy I have, this file syntax in section 2.7 lacks the
     $account keyword which is only mentioned deep in the text of section
     3.10.
   - As an addition to the tutorial documentation, it might be helpful to
     solicit user contributed ledger files.  I'd be willing to contribute what
     I'm using internally - I have a fairly complex customer payment
     processing methodology that keeps track of account receivable, and
     collected but undeposited payments.

** DEFERRED [[bug:242][#242]] Ledger example: building a better "du"					 :ATTACH:
   - State "DEFERRED"   from "TODO"       [2009-10-26 Mon 22:06]
   Since Ledger does not internally focus on finance, there is no reason why
   it can't be used in any situation where amounts are either kept in certain
   places, or moved from place to place, including:
   
   - tracking time
   - recording data transfers between computers
   - recording scientific data (converting any input to any output)
   - reporting on the layout of your hard drive
   
   To show an example of this, I'm written a Python script called "ledger-du"
   which simply outputs whatever directories you specify as arguments in the
   form of Ledger entries.  There is one entry per file, where the "payee" is
   the file name, the "account" is a colon-separated directory hierarchy, and
   the "date" is the last modified time of the file.
   
   By running this script and sending the output to "/tmp/out.dat", you can
   now perform some very sophisticated queries on your data -- including
   showing you the same kind of information that the venerable "du" itself
   would show.  Except that now you can see the tree hierarchy with the
   "balance" command, and other enhancements to the basic form of "du".
   
   For example, here's a command that shows me where all my C++ source files
   are, subtotaled by the sub-directory that contains them, and sorted by
   total size.  The "equity" account (where all the bytes are balanced) even
   ends up telling me the total size of all C++ files in my queried directory:
   :SCRIPT:
   ledger --format \
     "%D %-.20P\n  %-.52A %12.67t %12.80T\n%/  %-.52A %12.67t %12.80T\n" \
     -f /tmp/out.dat -s -S "-U(t)" register -- \\.cc\$
   :END:
   
   I specified a new format string here (a variation on the default balance
   format) so that I could see account totals each on their own line, since
   some of the account names get very long.
