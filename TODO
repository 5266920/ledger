   Every use of COMMODITY within the range of transactions has a fixed cost, as
   if the user had typed COMMODITY {= AMOUNT}.

** TODO Having problems exporting std::pair<T, U *> from Boost.Python
   This is the e-mail I was drafting for the mailing list, in response to
   [[message://770306.78630.qm@web111402.mail.gq1.yahoo.com][Re: {boost} Boost.Python question about converters and make_getter]]:

   Just one quick question:

   I have a Boost.Python method that looks like this:

     .def("__iter__", range<return_value_policy<return_by_value> >
	  (py_pool_commodities_begin, py_pool_commodities_end))

   Where the members of the map are std::pair<string, MyObject *>.  I want the
   pair passed by value, but I need the "second" member to be accessed using
   reference_existing_object.
