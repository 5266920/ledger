  I know this is intended behaviour, -J is not supposed to work with multiple
  commodities.  But --exchange should be able to make it work IMHO -- and it
  does it quite well without the -M flag.

  I think this might be related to some bugs reported recently in the
  mailing-list (it mentionned -J and multiple commodities too).

** TODO There is a bug with the new fixed rate feature				    :LINK:ATTACH:
   - Note taken on [2009-12-11 Fri 02:12] \\
     Javier [[message://92a1cace0912100848v3b6e81bfp332590a8057d73fe@mail.gmail.com][writes]]:

     I found that the problem is not related to the new "fixed" directive at all.

     After looking through the fixed-directive code I couldn't find any problems
     with it. I also noticed that the annotation details change between parsing
     time (when they are fine) and the amount::value() call.

     Then I changed all my fixed directives in the ledger file to {=$####} entries
     for all the foreign currencies (no "fixed" directive in the whole file) and
     the problem persisted!: some {=} entries used the wrong price from another {=}
     entry.

     I think the problem is somewhere between parsing and applying the algorithms
     (at least for -V reg) where the original post details seem to have changed. At
     least for ANNOTATION_PRICE_FIXATED entries. (I used printf's in parsing and in
     amount_t::value() to see the price change).

     This is the command i'm using: ./ledger -f multicurrency-no-fixed.ledger -V
     reg payable:jlopez

     I ran this with the master branch on ubuntu 64 bits.
