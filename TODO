  I know this is intended behaviour, -J is not supposed to work with multiple
  commodities.  But --exchange should be able to make it work IMHO -- and it
  does it quite well without the -M flag.

  I think this might be related to some bugs reported recently in the
  mailing-list (it mentionned -J and multiple commodities too).

*** TODO Specifying exchange rate with @ doesn't led to expected result
    While entering some expense reports, I found another case where specifying
    the exchange rate with @ doesn't led to the expected result because of
    rounding (I can give an example if you want).  I suppose I could simply
    enter the amounts using @@ but would like to add the conversation rate too.
    Is something like "11.04 GBP @@ 12.46 EUR ; @ 1.129 EUR" the best option
    for now or is there another trick I could use?

    - Note taken on [2009-12-11 Fri 02:12] \\
      Javier [[message://92a1cace0912100848v3b6e81bfp332590a8057d73fe@mail.gmail.com][writes]]: I found that the problem is not related to the new "fixed"
      directive at all.

      After looking through the fixed-directive code I couldn't find any
      problems with it. I also noticed that the annotation details change
      between parsing time (when they are fine) and the amount::value() call.

      Then I changed all my fixed directives in the ledger file to {=$####}
      entries for all the foreign currencies (no "fixed" directive in the whole
      file) and the problem persisted!: some {=} entries used the wrong price
      from another {=} entry.

      I think the problem is somewhere between parsing and applying the
      algorithms (at least for -V reg) where the original post details seem to
      have changed. At least for ANNOTATION_PRICE_FIXATED entries. (I used
      printf's in parsing and in amount_t::value() to see the price change).

      This is the command i'm using: ./ledger -f multicurrency-no-fixed.ledger
      -V reg payable:jlopez

      I ran this with the master branch on ubuntu 64 bits.

** DEFERRED @@ -- allow negative costs
   - State "DEFERRED"   from "TODO"       [2009-10-25 Sun 22:05]
   I am quite keen on the @@ syntax, as I like to deal with commodities on a
   net basis. However, there is a bit of an inconsistency between @@ and @.
 
   Suppose I have the ledger file:
   :DATA:
2008/01/01 * Purchase Apple shares
       Equities        1000 AAPL @ $2
       Cash

2008/06/30 * Sell some Apple shares
       Equities        -500 AAPL @ $2.5
       Cash
   :END:
   If I type:
   :SCRIPT:
ledger -f example01.txt -jB reg Equities
   :END:
   I get the output:
   :OUTPUT:
2008-01-01 2000
2008-06-30 -1250
   :END:
 
   The above is correct. $2000 goes in as equities as an asset, and £1250 is
   marked as a negative, thereby reducing the equity balance.
 
   Now. Suppose I decide I would rather use the @@ command. I would have a
   ledger file:
   :DATA:
2008/01/01 * Purchase Apple shares
   Equities    1000 AAPL @@ $2000
   Cash

2008/06/30 * Sell some Apple shares
   Equities    -500 AAPL @@ $1250
   Cash
   :END:
   If I type:
   :SCRIPT:
ledger -f example01.txt -jB reg Equities
   :END:
   I now get the output:
   :OUTPUT:
2008-01-01 2000
2008-06-30 1250
   :END:
 
   The above is incorrect, because the +1250 has changed to -1250. It implies
   the purchase of shares, rather than a sale. I can't just change the $1250 to
   -$1250 in the ledger file, either, because it complains:
   :OUTPUT:
Error: A posting's cost may not be negative

** DEFERRED Add a {{total}} syntax for lot price specification
   - State "DEFERRED"   from "TODO"       [2009-10-25 Sun 22:06]
   I had another idea: do you remember I mentioned a problem I had, which that
   some of my trade confirmation slips provide the "adjusted cost base" and not
   the cost-per-share? This makes it a big ugly to enter such postings, even
   with expressions:
   :DATA:
     BrokerAccount    -29.435 WIDGETS {353.51435/29.435 USD} @ 13.02 USD
   :END:
   (I didn't test the above, by the way, that was your suggestion when we
   talked last time.)

   I propose this syntax:
   :DATA:
     BrokerAccount    -29.435 WIDGETS {{353.51435 USD}} @ 13.02 USD
   :END:
   It's a bit similar to the idea of @ vs. @@ where the single char (@) is for
   price, and the double (@@) is for total amount. Using {{ ... }} refers to
   the total cost, while { ... } refers to the cost price (per share).

** DEFERRED Add an entry type for specifying value constraints
   - State "DEFERRED"   from "TODO"       [2009-10-25 Sun 22:06]
   I'd like to see a more general syntax for this based on value expressions,
   which would offer a full constraints mechanism.  For example, to constrain
   all transactions to being less than $10,000 in an account:
   :DATA:
? Constrain all transactions to less than $10,000
  /Expenses:Food/      a < $10,000
   :END:

   The "?" indicates a "constraints entry".  Each transaction would have two
   value expressions: one to match every applicable transaction in the file,
   and another to provide the boolean logic of the constraint.
 
   Then, while the file is being parsed, any violations of a constraint would
   be treated as an error, the same as when an entry fails to balance to zero.
   I suppose making these warnings could be a possibility as well.
 
   Here is how you'd constrain commodities in this model:
   :DATA:
? Guarantee commodities within accounts
  Assets:Checking    comm(a) == $1.00
   :END:
 
   (At the moment there is no value expr function that would allow: comm(a) ==
   "$")
 
   Then, of course, there could be a specific declaration option -- such as you
   have above -- for just this case, which internally would be parsed as a
   constraints entry.

   Please keep in mind that the dictionary one pulls account names from is MUCH

   a string $foo, it is easy to tell if this is the hash of "Bar, Inc." or
   "Baz, Inc.".  So, while in theory it is hard to reverse, it becomes very
   easy in practice if I know anything about your company or even the language
   that the accounts will be in.  Finally, because of rainbow tables, these
   might even be easy to reverse without knowing anything about the target
   company.

   Use the following ledger data
   :DATA:
2004/05/01 * Checking balance
  Assets:Bank:Checking        1000.00
  Equity:Opening Balances
   :END:

** DEFERRED Use Python to create a per-account debit/credit report
   - State "DEFERRED"   from "TODO"       [2009-10-25 Sun 22:04]
   Is there a way to let ledger output its reports showing the accounts in the
   more conventional way as debit and credit accounts, instead of having a
   positive or negative saldo?
 
   Here is one example:
   :OUTPUT:
Assets:Bank
Tr.#	date		Text			debit		credit		saldo
1	2008-01-01	Mr. Sponsor		500				500
2	2008-01-02	Bill					100		400

Income:Donations
Tr.#	date		Text			debit		credit		saldo
1	2008-01-01	Mr. Sponsor				500		-500

Expenses:Electricity
Tr.#	date		Text			debit		credit		saldo
2	2008-01-02	Bill			100				100
   :END:
   There should be a way of distinguishing between debit accounts, as assets
   and expenses, and credit accounts, as Income and liabilities. It is of
   course possible to processs ledger's output to achieve this, but it would be
   nice if it could be done in ledger directly.

** DEFERRED [#C] Ledger example: building a better "du"					 :ATTACH:
   - State "DEFERRED"   from "TODO"       [2009-10-26 Mon 22:06]
   Since Ledger does not internally focus on finance, there is no reason why
   it can't be used in any situation where amounts are either kept in certain
   places, or moved from place to place, including:
   
   - tracking time
   - recording data transfers between computers
   - recording scientific data (converting any input to any output)
   - reporting on the layout of your hard drive
   
   To show an example of this, I'm written a Python script called "ledger-du"
   which simply outputs whatever directories you specify as arguments in the
   form of Ledger entries.  There is one entry per file, where the "payee" is
   the file name, the "account" is a colon-separated directory hierarchy, and
   the "date" is the last modified time of the file.
   
   By running this script and sending the output to "/tmp/out.dat", you can
   now perform some very sophisticated queries on your data -- including
   showing you the same kind of information that the venerable "du" itself
   would show.  Except that now you can see the tree hierarchy with the
   "balance" command, and other enhancements to the basic form of "du".
   
   For example, here's a command that shows me where all my C++ source files
   are, subtotaled by the sub-directory that contains them, and sorted by
   total size.  The "equity" account (where all the bytes are balanced) even
   ends up telling me the total size of all C++ files in my queried directory:
   :SCRIPT:
   ledger --format \
     "%D %-.20P\n  %-.52A %12.67t %12.80T\n%/  %-.52A %12.67t %12.80T\n" \
     -f /tmp/out.dat -s -S "-U(t)" register -- \\.cc\$
   :END:
   
   I specified a new format string here (a variation on the default balance
   format) so that I could see account totals each on their own line, since
   some of the account names get very long.
