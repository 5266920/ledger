** TODO [[bug:200][#200]] Commodities containing digits and ledger bal
   - Note taken on [2010-06-03 Thu 06:02] \\
     You could simply drop the quotes if the commodity doesn't contain any
     spaces.
   - Note taken on [2010-06-02 Wed 18:12] \\
     What if you have a Commodity named "FOO 100", which is perfectly legal.
     And then the register or balance report prints out "200 FOO 100".  What
     then?
   - Note taken on [2010-06-02 Wed 18:12] \\
     Martin: Why do we need an extra option for this?  Is there a reason this
     cannot be done by default?
     
     In any case, I'm not sure it makes sense to add an option just for this
     minor thing.  If it cannot be done by default without an option, I guess
     you could just close this bug as WONTFIX.
    - Note taken on [2010-06-02 Wed 16:54] \\
      I will add an option called --no-quotes.
    When you have a commodity that contains digits, you have to put it on
    quotation marks, as in;
#+begin_src sh
    2010-04-02 Test
      Assets:Broker                 10 "DE0002635307" @ 10
      Assets:Bank
#+end_src    
    
    ledger bal will also put this commodity in quotation marks.  Is this
    necessary?  IMHO it would be nicer if "ledger bal" would strip the
    quotation mark.

** TODO [[bug:201][#201]] Handling currencies that were replaced by the Euro
    - Note taken on [2010-05-28 Fri 00:59] \\
      Okay, using
      #+begin_src sh
       C 1.00 EUR = 13.7603 ATS
      #+end_src
      rather than
      #+begin_src sh
       P 2001-12-31 EUR 13.7603 ATS
      #+end_src
      solves most of these issues.
      
      However, would it be possible to add a date for C?  I'd like to see ATS
      before 2002-01-01 and EUR from then on.
    There are a couple of problems with ledger when using currencies that were
    replaced by the Euro as well as the Euro.
    
    First, I know that ledger is mostly designed as a "calculator" without any
    knowledge about the actual input.  However, given that some currencies
    were replaced by the Euro and have fixed exchange rates that will not
    change, it would be nice if ledger would know about those.  How about
    adding a text file to ledger that is read by default with such fixed
    conversion rates?  (If you agree, I'm happy to write one for the
    currencies replaced by the Euro.)
    
    Related to this is a problem with showing currencies.  Let's say that I
    have accounts with ATS, EUR and GBP.  How can I tell ledger to convert ATS
    to EUR but do no other conversation.  -X EUR won't work because it would
    also convert GBP, but I want to see both EUR and GBP (I just want the
    obsolete ATS to be converted to EUR).  Is this possible somehow?
    
    Finally, there appear to be some artefacts because ledger doesn't know
    that ATS is a currency replaced by EUR.  Normally, "ledger bal" does not
    display accounts that are empty (see the first example below).  But if I
    put something into an account as ATS and then take out exactly the same
    amount (but as EUR), "ledger bal" will show the account name and "0"
    (probably because it switches to commodity mode).
    
    Example:
    
    a)
#+begin_src sh
    2010-04-02 Test
       A:Foo  10.00
       A:Bar
    
    2010-04-02 Test
       A:Foo  -10.00
       A:Baz
#+end_src
    
    b)
#+begin_src sh
    P 2001-12-31 EUR 13.7603 ATS
    
    2001-01-01 Test
       B:Foo  13.7603 ATS
       B:Bar
    
    2010-04-02 Test
       B:Foo  -1.00 EUR
       B:Baz
#+end_src
    
    a) will show no Foo with "ledger bal" but b) will show "0 Foo".

    - State "DEFERRED"   from "TODO"       [2010-06-02 Wed 01:41] \\
      You are right, --percent cannot handle multiple commodities.  And since
      --exchange always takes place after --percent, it's not as
      straightforward as it seems.  I'm going to defer this bug until after
      3.0, since it may not be worth fixing.  But I'll keep thinking on it.
    I've found that --percent option is incompatible with --exchange.  Well,
    actually I suspect that --percent is not able to handle multi currencies.

    In the following simple exemple, I would have expected that --percent
    option works correctly.

** TODO [[bug:232][#232]] Support variant behaviors for -V
   The problem is: for a given amount of a commodity, which commodity should
   its value be reported in terms of?

   1. For a transaction, an amount of the commodity might be permanently
      associated with another commodity.  This is a "price value".
   2. For a certain commodity, another commodity may always be the pricing
      commodity.  This is a "commodity value".
   3. For a certain account, a specific commodity may always be used for
      pricing.  This is an "account value".
   4. For a certain report, the user may request valuation using a list of
      candidate commodities.  This is a "report value".
   5. Otherwise, the user may desire simply the most recent valuation
      possible.  This is a "market value".

   So the target commodity might be bound to: a particular amount, a
   commodity, or an account.  If it's not bound during parsing, it may be
   bound during reporting using -X to specify a commodity.  If it's not bound
   at all, then it is valued using the most recent prices available, no matter
   their commodity.

   Then here is the logic:

   1.  If --exchange-only is specified, use those commodities.
   2.  Else if a commodity has been FIXED to the amount, use that.
   3.  Else if a commodity has been FIXED to the account, use that.
   4.  Else if a commodity has been FIXED to the commodity, use that.
   5.  Else if the amount's commodity is itself primary, use that.

** DEFERRED [[bug:268][#268]] @@ -- allow negative costs
   - State "DEFERRED"   from "TODO"       [2009-10-25 Sun 22:05]
   I am quite keen on the @@ syntax, as I like to deal with commodities on a
   net basis. However, there is a bit of an inconsistency between @@ and @.
 
   Suppose I have the ledger file:
   :DATA:
2008/01/01 * Purchase Apple shares
       Equities        1000 AAPL @ $2
       Cash

2008/06/30 * Sell some Apple shares
       Equities        -500 AAPL @ $2.5
       Cash
   :END:
   If I type:
   :SCRIPT:
ledger -f example01.txt -jB reg Equities
   :END:
   I get the output:
   :OUTPUT:
2008-01-01 2000
2008-06-30 -1250
   :END:
 
   The above is correct. $2000 goes in as equities as an asset, and £1250 is
   marked as a negative, thereby reducing the equity balance.
 
   Now. Suppose I decide I would rather use the @@ command. I would have a
   ledger file:
   :DATA:
2008/01/01 * Purchase Apple shares
   Equities    1000 AAPL @@ $2000
   Cash

2008/06/30 * Sell some Apple shares
   Equities    -500 AAPL @@ $1250
   Cash
   :END:
   If I type:
   :SCRIPT:
ledger -f example01.txt -jB reg Equities
   :END:
   I now get the output:
   :OUTPUT:
2008-01-01 2000
2008-06-30 1250
   :END:
 
   The above is incorrect, because the +1250 has changed to -1250. It implies
   the purchase of shares, rather than a sale. I can't just change the $1250 to
   -$1250 in the ledger file, either, because it complains:
   :OUTPUT:
Error: A posting's cost may not be negative

   - State "DEFERRED"   from "TODO"       [2009-10-25 Sun 22:06]
   I had another idea: do you remember I mentioned a problem I had, which that
   some of my trade confirmation slips provide the "adjusted cost base" and not
   the cost-per-share? This makes it a big ugly to enter such postings, even
   with expressions:
   :DATA:
     BrokerAccount    -29.435 WIDGETS {353.51435/29.435 USD} @ 13.02 USD
   :END:
   (I didn't test the above, by the way, that was your suggestion when we
   talked last time.)

   I propose this syntax:
   :DATA:
     BrokerAccount    -29.435 WIDGETS {{353.51435 USD}} @ 13.02 USD
   :END:
   It's a bit similar to the idea of @ vs. @@ where the single char (@) is for
   price, and the double (@@) is for total amount. Using {{ ... }} refers to
   the total cost, while { ... } refers to the cost price (per share).

   - State "DEFERRED"   from "TODO"       [2009-10-25 Sun 22:06]
   I'd like to see a more general syntax for this based on value expressions,
   which would offer a full constraints mechanism.  For example, to constrain
   all transactions to being less than $10,000 in an account:
   :DATA:
? Constrain all transactions to less than $10,000
  /Expenses:Food/      a < $10,000
   :END:

   The "?" indicates a "constraints entry".  Each transaction would have two
   value expressions: one to match every applicable transaction in the file,
   and another to provide the boolean logic of the constraint.
 
   Then, while the file is being parsed, any violations of a constraint would
   be treated as an error, the same as when an entry fails to balance to zero.
   I suppose making these warnings could be a possibility as well.
 
   Here is how you'd constrain commodities in this model:
   :DATA:
? Guarantee commodities within accounts
  Assets:Checking    comm(a) == $1.00
   :END:
 
   (At the moment there is no value expr function that would allow: comm(a) ==
   "$")
 
   Then, of course, there could be a specific declaration option -- such as you
   have above -- for just this case, which internally would be parsed as a
   constraints entry.

   "Baz, Inc.".  So, while in theory it is hard to reverse, it becomes very
   easy in practice if I know anything about your company or even the language
   that the accounts will be in.  Finally, because of rainbow tables, these
   might even be easy to reverse without knowing anything about the target
   company.

   Use the following ledger data
   :DATA:
2004/05/01 * Checking balance
  Assets:Bank:Checking        1000.00
  Equity:Opening Balances
   :END:

   With cursor on the beginning of the second line, eval

   It is not correct, since 1000.00 ought to be amount.
 
   ledger-context-at-point also fails to parse amount with ',' in it, such as:

** DEFERRED [[bug:315][#315]] Use Python to create a per-account debit/credit report
   - State "DEFERRED"   from "TODO"       [2009-10-25 Sun 22:04]
   Is there a way to let ledger output its reports showing the accounts in the
   more conventional way as debit and credit accounts, instead of having a
   positive or negative saldo?
 
   Here is one example:
   :OUTPUT:
Assets:Bank
Tr.#	date		Text			debit		credit		saldo
1	2008-01-01	Mr. Sponsor		500				500
2	2008-01-02	Bill					100		400

Income:Donations
Tr.#	date		Text			debit		credit		saldo
1	2008-01-01	Mr. Sponsor				500		-500

Expenses:Electricity
Tr.#	date		Text			debit		credit		saldo
2	2008-01-02	Bill			100				100
   :END:
   There should be a way of distinguishing between debit accounts, as assets
   and expenses, and credit accounts, as Income and liabilities. It is of
   course possible to processs ledger's output to achieve this, but it would be
   nice if it could be done in ledger directly.

** DEFERRED [[bug:242][#242]] Ledger example: building a better "du"					 :ATTACH:
   - State "DEFERRED"   from "TODO"       [2009-10-26 Mon 22:06]
   Since Ledger does not internally focus on finance, there is no reason why
   it can't be used in any situation where amounts are either kept in certain
   places, or moved from place to place, including:
   
   - tracking time
   - recording data transfers between computers
   - recording scientific data (converting any input to any output)
   - reporting on the layout of your hard drive
   
   To show an example of this, I'm written a Python script called "ledger-du"
   which simply outputs whatever directories you specify as arguments in the
   form of Ledger entries.  There is one entry per file, where the "payee" is
   the file name, the "account" is a colon-separated directory hierarchy, and
   the "date" is the last modified time of the file.
   
   By running this script and sending the output to "/tmp/out.dat", you can
   now perform some very sophisticated queries on your data -- including
   showing you the same kind of information that the venerable "du" itself
   would show.  Except that now you can see the tree hierarchy with the
   "balance" command, and other enhancements to the basic form of "du".
   
   For example, here's a command that shows me where all my C++ source files
   are, subtotaled by the sub-directory that contains them, and sorted by
   total size.  The "equity" account (where all the bytes are balanced) even
   ends up telling me the total size of all C++ files in my queried directory:
   :SCRIPT:
   ledger --format \
     "%D %-.20P\n  %-.52A %12.67t %12.80T\n%/  %-.52A %12.67t %12.80T\n" \
     -f /tmp/out.dat -s -S "-U(t)" register -- \\.cc\$
   :END:
   
   I specified a new format string here (a variation on the default balance
   format) so that I could see account totals each on their own line, since
   some of the account names get very long.
