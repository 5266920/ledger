  Can now parse timeclock files.  These are simple timelogs that track
  in/out events, which can be maintained using my timeclock tool.  By
  allowing ledger to parse these, it means that reporting can be done
  on them in the same way as a ledger file (the commodities is "h",
  for hours); and it means that doing things like tracking billable
  hours for clients, and invoicing those clients to transfer those
  hours into a dollar value via a receivable account, is now trivial.
  See the docs for more on how to do this.

  Began keeping NEWS file. :)
