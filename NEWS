  Pricing histories are now supported, so that ledger remembers
  historical prices of all commodities (if this information is
  provided), and can give register reports based on past and present
  market values, as well as original cost basis.

  Can now parse timeclock files.  These are simple timelogs that track
  in/out events, which can be maintained using my timeclock tool.  By
  allowing ledger to parse these, it means that reporting can be done
  on them in the same way as a ledger file (the commodities is "h",
  for hours); and it means that doing things like tracking billable
  hours for clients, and invoicing those clients to transfer those
  hours into a dollar value via a receivable account, is now trivial.
  See the docs for more on how to do this.

  Began keeping NEWS file. :)
