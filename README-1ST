===============================================================================

To build this code after doing a Git clone, run:

    $ ./acprep update

If you try to configure/build on your own, you are almost certainly going to
run into problems.  In future, you can run this command again and it will keep
you updated with the very latest version.

===============================================================================

                                    F.A.Q.

   ----------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Q: The build fails saying it can't find utf8.h

   A: You didn't run ./acprep update.

   ----------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Q: Configure fails saying it can't find boost_regex

   A: Look in config.log and search for "boost_regex", then scroll down a bit
      until you see the exact compile error.  Usually it's failing because
      your include directory is different from anything acprep is expecting to
      see.  It could also be failing because your Boost libraries have a
      custom "suffix" on them.

      Let's say your Boost was installed in ~/boost, and every library has the
      suffix '-xgcc42'.  This is what you would run:

        CPPFLAGS=-I$HOME/boost acprep --boost=xgcc42 update

   ----------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Q: Configure fails saying it can't find MPFR

   A: You need MPFR version 2.4.0 or higher.  This version does not come with
      most Debian distributions, so you will need to build it.

   ----------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Q: Something else fails, or Ledger crashes on startup

   A: This, I am most interested in hearing about.  Please e-mail me a copy of
      config.log and your build log to <johnw@newartisans.com>.  Also, if
      Ledger is crashing, try running it under gdb like so:

        $ gdb ledger
        (gdb) run <ARGS TO LEDGER>
        ... runs till crash ...
        (gdb) bt

      Send me that backtrace output, and the output from "ledger --version".
