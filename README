Welcome to Ledger, a command-line accounting program.

Quick start
===========

To build Ledger, you will first need these two libraries installed:

    gmp        GNU multi-precision library
    pcre       Perl regular expression library

If you wish to read Gnucash data files, you will also need two XML
libraries, which may or may not be available in a single package (it
depends on your distribution):

    xmlparse
    xmltok

Once you have determined where the headers and libraries for the above
packages are installed, run the script "configure", passing those
paths.  If you installed everything under /usr/local, you can probably
just type "./configure".  Otherwise, do this:

    ./configure CPPFLAGS=-I<INCLUDE-PATH>  LDFLAGS=-L<LIBRARY-PATH>

If you need to specify multiple include or library paths, then do
this:

    ./configure CPPFLAGS="-I<PATH1> -I<PATH2>"  LDFLAGS="-L<PATH1> -L<PATH2>"

Once configure is done running, just type:

    make install


Mailing List and IRC
====================

If you need help on how to use Ledger, or run into problems, you can
just the Ledger mailing list at the following Web address:

    https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/ledger-discuss

You can also find help at the #ledger channel on the IRC server
irc.freenode.net.


Building Ledger as a Python Module
==================================

If you have Python 2.2 or higher installed, and Boost.Python, then
Ledger can also be built as a Python module, if --enable-python is
passed to the configure script.  This means you can interact with your
Ledger data from Python, making it easy to write custom reports.

This feature is mostly undocumented in version 2.0, although main.py
is offered as a working example.
