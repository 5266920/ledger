Welcome to ledger, a command-line accounting program that uses a
text-based ledger file, yet provides full double-entry accouting, use
of commodities, unlimited accounts, etc.

Ledger is written in ANSI C++, and should compile on any platform.  It
only depends on the GNU multiprecision integer library (gmp, or
libgmp), and the Perl regular expression library (pcre, or libpcre).
Also, this project was developed using GNU make and gcc 3.3.

To build and install, once you have these libraries on your system,
enter these commands:

  make
  cp ledger /usr/local/bin
