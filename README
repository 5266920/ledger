Hello, and welcome to the Ledger source code.

If you're reading this README file (rather than the version in
doc/README), it means that you've pulled the sources using Git and are
prepared to embark on the heady adventure that is compiling and running
the Ledger Bleeding Edge.

Well, at least we warned you.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you wish to proceed in this venture, you'll need a few dependencies:

  - Boost 1.35
  - CppUnit 1.12.1

  - Optionally, Python 2.4 or higher
  - Optionally, libexpat or libxml2
  - Optionally, libofx

For the convenience of my fellow developers, you may download some of
these dependencies quite easily, right here and now.  Just run this
command:

  git submodule update --init

You'll now have a few extra source trees in lib/.  There's even a
Makefile there, which will build and install Boost and CppUnit into
appropriate places in /usr/local/stow.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The next step is preparing your environment for building.  While you can
just use 'autoreconf -fi', I've prepared a script that does a lot of the
footwork for you:

  ./acprep

If you want to run with complete debugging on, as I do, use this:

  ./acprep --devel

Please read the contents of 'acprep' in this case, especially the
section which documents the --devel option.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once you have the dependencies installed and the source prepared for
building, just run 'make'.  If you have CppUnit installed, I prefer that
you always run 'make fullcheck', as this will verify Ledger against the
unit tests, the Python unit tests (if applicable), and the regression
tests, for your platform.

If you have extra CPU cycles to burn, try even 'make distcheck', which
provides the most thorough shakedown of a healthy source tree.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now that you're up and running, here are a few resources to keep in
mind:

  Home page              http://www.newartisans.com/software/ledger.html

  IRC channel		 #ledger on irc.freenode.net
  Mailing List / Forum   http://groups.google.com/group/ledger-cli
  Issue Tracker          http://trac.newartisans.com/ledger
  GitHub project page    http://github.com/jwiegley/ledger/tree/master
  Buildbot display	 http://www.newartisans.com:9090
  Ohloh code analysis	 http://www.ohloh.net/projects/ledger

If you have coding ideas you want to share, the best way is either to
e-mail me a patch (I prefer ttachments over pasted text), or to get an
account on GitHub.  Once you do, fork the Ledger project, hack as much
as you like, then send me a message via GitHub asking me to check out
your repository.  I'm only too happy to do so for anyone who takes time
out of their schedule to help the Ledger project.
