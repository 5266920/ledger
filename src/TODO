- Add tracing code for functions that records call count and total
  time spent, as well as average time per call.  This would implement
  selective profiling.

- Make sure that if any constructors cause memory to be allocated,
  that the memory is held by an auto_ptr until the constructor is
  done; otherwise, an exception raised from within the constructor
  will not call the destructor to free the memory.

- Using mmap for the binary reader; or determine if the performance is
  even worth the maintenance headaches of that code altogether.
