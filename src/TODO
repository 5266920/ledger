- What does SEQUENCE + VALUE mean in XPath?  Does it add VALUE to
  every member of SEQUENCE?

- Add tracing code for functions that records call count and total
  time spent, as well as average time per call.  This would implement
  selective profiling.

- Make sure that if any constructors cause memory to be allocated,
  that the memory is held by an auto_ptr until the constructor is
  done; otherwise, an exception raised from within the constructor
  will not call the destructor to free the memory.

- Using mmap for the binary reader; or determine if the performance is
  even worth the maintenance headaches of that code altogether.

- Rewrite the error context reporting logic, then tie in the logging
  facility to it (so that warning can be reported with context, and
  debug statements can be filtered by context).

    PUSH_CONTEXT("amount.divide");
    POP_CONTEXT(amount_context2("Dividing amounts", amt1, amt2));
