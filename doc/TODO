* TODO [#B] Budgeting oddness
  I am trying to understand the budgeting information in the ledger
  documentation, as well as to understand some basic syntax in my ledger file
  and why it does not appear to be working correctly.  If I have a ledger file
  with:
  :DATA:
~Monthly
   Exp:....   $1000.00
   Exp:....   $500.00
   Exp:....   $250.00
   Exp:....   $1000.00
   Assets
  :END:
  [with real categories blanked out, of course], and Assets at the end, what
  does this imply?  That expenses will be withdrawn/balanced against assets?
  What happens if I have no expenses recorded in my ledger, e.g., what is the
  intended behavior of the budgeting functionality?

  In addition, the following three entries seem to be causing somewhat odd
  behavior:
  :DATA:
2006/05/23
     Assets:Checking:xxxx             $1259.44
     Equity:Opening Balance

2006/05/23
     Assets:Savings:xxxx               $711.31
     Equity:Opening Balance

2006/05/23
     Expenses:Loans:xxxx               $750.00
     Assets:Checking:xxxx
  :END:

  When I perform:
  :OUTPUT:
% ledger -f ~/ledger.txt -MAs bal ^expenses
              $375.00  Expenses:Loans
              $750.00    xxxx
--------------------
              $375.00
  :END:
  and these are the only three entries in the ledger file, did I miss
  something as far as the intended behavior?  Is there a bug somewhere in my
  libgmp, etc?

  I'm on Mac OS X 10.4 on an Intel machine.

* TODO [#B] Bug in ledger equity output
  Seeing as how I've reached the end of my financial year my thoughts turned
  to how to 'close the books'.

  I have the following as part of my account tree:
  :DATA:
Assets:Super:ARF
Assets:Super:CSS
Assets:Super:CSS:Contributions
  :END:

  The ledger 'balance' report correctly shows `Contributions` to be a child of
  `Assets:Super:CSS`:
  :OUTPUT:
$ ledger -l 'd<=[30/06/2006]' -w -s bal ^Assets:Super
         $171,819.90  Assets:Super
          $12,777.87    ARF
         $159,042.03    CSS
           $3,861.00      Contributions
--------------------
         $171,819.90
  :END:

  However the ledger `equity` report formats `Contributions` as a new
  top-level account:
  :OUTPUT:
$ ledger -l 'd<=[30/06/2006]' -w equity ^Assets:Super

14/07/2006 Opening Balances
    Assets:Super:ARF                      $12,777.87
    Assets:Super:CSS                     $155,181.03
    Contributions                          $3,861.00
                                        $-171,819.90
  :END:

  Whilst its no great issue to manually edit the report (have to change the
  date anyway) its slightly annoying.

  Use the following ledger data
  :DATA:
2004/05/01 * Checking balance
  Assets:Bank:Checking        1000.00
  Equity:Opening Balances
  :END:

  With cursor on the beginning of the second line, eval
  `(ledger-context-at-point)`, which returns:
  :OUTPUT:
(acct-transaction account ((indent "  " 31) (account "Assets:Bank:Checking        1000.00" 33)))
  :END:
  It is not correct, since 1000.00 ought to be amount.

  ledger-context-at-point also fails to parse amount with ',' in it, such as:
  :DATA:
2004/05/01 * Checking balance
  Assets:Bank:Checking        $1,000.00

* TODO [#B] Problem with piping input to ledger
  I decided to just go ahead and push my whole ledger file through "print".
  At first I had been a little nervous about the possibility that I might goof
  up somehow and lose some data.  But it seems to have worked okay: I did a
  spot check of the result by verifying that my checking account and credit
  card accounts still end up with the same final balance as they did before.
  Also, I typically save any edits to my ledger file in a Subversion
  repository, so I can always get back to a previous version if I need to.
  
  So now I do have a nice, clean file.
  
  After I got your message, I did try the "output" command.  I guess I didn't
  understand exactly what it's supposed to be doing, because it didn't quite
  seem to work as I expected.
  
  If I type:
  :SCRIPT:
ledger -f foo output foo
  :END:
  is it supposed to rewrite foo?  It didn't seem to do that.  Instead, it
  seems to write its output onto stdout.  And not only that, it seems to
  duplicate the last entry in the file.

  For example, if this is my sample file foo:
  :DATA:
2006/01/01 * Xyzzy Mortgage Co.
    Assets:Bank:Checking                  $-1,000.00
    Expenses:Interest:Mortage              $950.00
    Liabilities:Mortgage                     $50.00

Y2005

01/01 * (1830) TPC
    Expenses:Phone                  $100.00
    Assets:Bank:Checking                            

2/3 (1832) ABC Dept Store
    Expenses:Clothing           $100.00
    Assets:Bank:Checking
  :END:

  Then when I run `ledger -f foo output foo` the output I get is this:
  :OUTPUT:
2006/01/01 * Xyzzy Mortgage Co.
    Assets:Bank:Checking                  $-1,000.00
    Expenses:Interest:Mortage                $950.00
    Liabilities:Mortgage                      $50.00

Y2005

2005/01/01 * (1830) TPC
    Expenses:Phone                           $100.00
    Assets:Bank:Checking                            

2005/02/03 (1832) ABC Dept Store
    Expenses:Clothing                        $100.00
    Assets:Bank:Checking                            
2/3 (1832) ABC Dept Store
    Expenses:Clothing           $100.00
    Assets:Bank:Checking
  :END:

  If instead I run `ledger -f foo output foo2`, then I get this:
  :OUTPUT:
Error: Journal does not refer to file ''
  :END:
  So I guess that wan't what I was supposed to do.

  Anyway, this is all just academic, 'cuz as I say I now have a nice, cleaned
  up file, thanks to the "print" command.

  Downloaded and (eventually) compiled the latest version from anonymous CVS.
  
  Had to update my 'automake' to 1.9 and add "#include <cassert>" to
  datetime.h to get it to make.
  
  Runs the help screen OK but SEGV's out when attempting to do any useful
  work.
  
  System is debian stable ('sarge'), gcc 3.3.5 fully upgraded.
  
  Any clues?

    Fixed by the following change:
       * walk.cc (handle_value): The transaction xdata.dflags were being
       set too late; the TRANSACTION_COMPOUND setting was being thrown
       away as a result.
  Although reg without shows a ton of Expenses:Food expenses, searching for
  food expenses shows none.

  The emacs report uses byte-positioning to indicate the beginning of entries

  The solution is either to support multi-byte correctly, or to use line

    This has already been fixed by A7CA0F5B-1F08-417A-9071-A223601100CA.
  I found a tiny bug in the info documentation for ledger, version
  2.6.0.90, regarding per-unit and complete transaction cost.  There
  seems to be @'s missing (maybe texinfo gobbles up at least on @)
  
  It says:
  
  > The `ACCOUNT' may be surrounded by parentheses if it is a virtual
  > transactions, or square brackets if it is a virtual transactions
  > that must balance.  The `AMOUNT' can be followed by a per-unit
  > transaction cost, by specifying ` AMOUNT', or a complete
  > transaction cost with `@ AMOUNT'.  Lastly
  
  whereas I believe (from reading the source of textual.cc) it should
  be: 
  
  > The `ACCOUNT' may be surrounded by parentheses if it is a virtual
  > transactions, or square brackets if it is a virtual transactions
  > that must balance.  The `AMOUNT' can be followed by a per-unit
  > transaction cost, by specifying `@ AMOUNT', or a complete
