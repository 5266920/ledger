* TODO [#B] ledger.el and reconcile don't to work with accounts that span files
  My ledger uses a static "Main" file which contains links to all the other
  accounts, some of which cross-reference.
  
  Thus the output of 'register' and the *Reconcile* buffer have a different
  amount and # of entries.
  
  The "visit-entry" is also broken, and fails frequently to find the
  appropriate location.

  - Ignore any line like /^\s*;/ as a comment -even in the middle of a
    transaction
  - Treat -00.00 the same as hB300.00 : I found myself making this mistake
    frequently.
  - Print the out offending transaction and the 'out of balance' amount in the
    'unbalanced transaction' error message.
  - It would be nice if the 'entry' command could be modified to assume the
    amount is the same as last time if you dont supply it.  It also doesn't
    seem to reproduce multiple-split transactions either -- it seems you only
    get the first split line.

* TODO [#C] Add an entry type for specifying value constraints
  I'd like to see a more general syntax for this based on value expressions,
  which would offer a full constraints mechanism.  For example, to constrain
  all transactions to being less than $10,000 in an account:
  :DATA:
? Constrain all transactions to less than $10,000
  /Expenses:Food/      a < $10,000
  :END:

  The "?" indicates a "constraints entry".  Each transaction would have two
  value expressions: one to match every applicable transaction in the file,
  and another to provide the boolean logic of the constraint.

  Then, while the file is being parsed, any violations of a constraint would
  be treated as an error, the same as when an entry fails to balance to zero.
  I suppose making these warnings could be a possibility as well.

  Here is how you'd constrain commodities in this model:
  :DATA:
? Guarantee commodities within accounts
  Assets:Checking    comm(a) == $1.00
  :END:

  (At the moment there is no value expr function that would allow: comm(a) ==
  "$")

  Then, of course, there could be a specific declaration option -- such as you
  have above -- for just this case, which internally would be parsed as a
  constraints entry.

* TODO [#C] Added a {{total}} syntax for lot price specification       :FEATURE:
  I had another idea: do you remember I mentioned a problem I had, which that
  some of my trade confirmation slips provide the "adjusted cost base" and not
  the cost-per-share? This makes it a big ugly to enter such postings, even
  with expressions:
  :DATA:  
    BrokerAccount    -29.435 WIDGETS {353.51435/29.435 USD} @ 13.02 USD
  :END:
  (I didn't test the above, by the way, that was your suggestion when we
  talked last time.)
  
  I propose this syntax:
  :DATA:  
    BrokerAccount    -29.435 WIDGETS {{353.51435 USD}} @ 13.02 USD
  :END:
  It's a bit similar to the idea of @ vs. @@ where the single char (@) is for
  price, and the double (@@) is for total amount. Using {{ ... }} refers to
  the total cost, while { ... } refers to the cost price (per share).

  :DATA:

   Exp:....   $500.00
   Exp:....   $250.00

  [with real categories blanked out, of course], and Assets at the end, what
  does this imply?  That expenses will be withdrawn/balanced against assets?
  What happens if I have no expenses recorded in my ledger, e.g., what is the
  intended behavior of the budgeting functionality?

  In addition, the following three entries seem to be causing somewhat odd
  behavior:
  :DATA:
2006/05/23
     Assets:Checking:xxxx             $1259.44
     Equity:Opening Balance

2006/05/23
     Assets:Savings:xxxx               $711.31

2006/05/23
     Expenses:Loans:xxxx               $750.00
     Assets:Checking:xxxx

  When I perform:
  :OUTPUT:
% ledger -f ~/ledger.txt -MAs bal ^expenses
              $375.00  Expenses:Loans
              $750.00    xxxx

  - State "TODO"       [2008-07-17 Thu 20:43] \\
    The output from this command is not what people would think it is, because it
    divides by total transactions, not months.  This is an issue to be addressed
    again in 2.7.
  The command is:
  :SCRIPT:

  - Note taken on [2008-07-21 Mon 18:53] \\
    I agree that we need something like this.  Also, whatever format is chosen, we
    should look at adding a flexible properties/tags/annotation mechanism for
    entries and transactions.
  12:47 < Demosthenes> i think we need a comment or further descriptive field that is preserved with the record
  12:47 < Nafai> That would probably be useful
  12:48 < Nafai> I can imagine, for example, in the future if I start scanning all of my receipts and such.  I'd like to be able to associate an entry with a given scan file
  12:48 < Nafai> I would do that via a comment, I suppose
  12:48 < Nafai> I'd bring it up on the mailing list and see what johnw thinks
  12:48 < Demosthenes> i was thinking expense report notes ;]
  13:02 < Demosthenes> if there were to be a comment, how would we make it look?
  13:03 < Demosthenes> my immediate suggestion would be to keep it freeform and use the ;, just that the parser would preserve the comments in the same text block as the ledger entry bounded by whitespace
  13:43 < Nafai> Yeah, that sounds reasonable
  14:16 < Demosthenes> then as an extension,  /^; ([A-Z][a-z]+): (.*)$/ could match key : value pairs for tags ;] 
  14:17 < Nafai> Nice
  14:24 < Demosthenes> good news is, i can go ahead and write comments that way, and we'll see if its added later ;]
  15:22 < johnw> let me show you what I'm thinking of, in the spirit of Python
  15:23 < johnw> http://rafb.net/p/jyagP679.html
  15:25 < johnw> so, ; inside an entry will be a note, ; outside is a comment

  Example from johnw:
  :DATA:

   ; This is an entry note, although it looks just like a comment.

    Because of the way that forecasting is (currently) implemented, you will often
    see an entry that is "one beyond" the condition of your forecast. I hope to
    remedy this in the near future.

* TODO [#B] FR: Add the concept of spatially delimited "pages"
  Another way to associate a custag tag/field to entries is by virtue of their
  organisation in the file. We could tag a sequence of consecutive entries in
  a block, like this:
  :DATA:
@page_begin Vacations

...

@page_end
  :END:

  This gives us yet another dimension of tagging of transactions:
  
  - The account in which a transaction belongs
  - The page in which a transaction was declared.
  - The "notes" at the end of postings
  - The description of the transaction
  - The file in which a transaction was defined.
  
  These are all fields that can be used for selecting a subset of
  transactions. Some of these fields may allow us to simplify our accounts
  hierarchy to some extent.

    Account1   100 EUR @ 1.4 USD
    Account1   -200 EUR

  You could calculate the cost:
  :OUTPUT:

   -200 EUR
   100 USD

  So, 240 USD and -200 EUR, which implies an aggregate exchange rate of 1.2,
  which is wildly different of the 1.4 EUR/USD rate declared above.
  
  (Do you fill in? In my Python version, I'll prefer not to, because I think

  Use the following ledger data
  :DATA:
2004/05/01 * Checking balance
  Assets:Bank:Checking        1000.00
  Equity:Opening Balances
  :END:

  With cursor on the beginning of the second line, eval
  `(ledger-context-at-point)`, which returns:

(acct-transaction account ((indent "  " 31) (account "Assets:Bank:Checking        1000.00" 33)))

  It is not correct, since 1000.00 ought to be amount.

  ledger-context-at-point also fails to parse amount with ',' in it, such as:

  I would like to use the XML format for doing some transformations to my

  This means I would like to export to XML, then do an XSLT transformation,
  and then re-import it back into ledger format. (Throw away my original
  ledger file, and replace it with the transformed version.)

  My problem is that comments don't seem to be preserved in the XML
  format. Well, the end-of-line comments on (what you call) transactions
  do. (They come out as <tr:note> elements.) But whole-line comments do not.

  I wish these whole-line comments could somehow be preserved in the XML

  The command is:
  :SCRIPT:
ledger -f utils/standard.dat -e 2004/4 -G reg 401
  :END:
  The results of this command are not at all what I would expect—even though
  they make sense!

  The difference is that in 2.4.1, all of the relevant revaluation lines were
  printed, such that the total made sense.

* TODO [#B] Problem with piping input to ledger
  I decided to just go ahead and push my whole ledger file through "print".
  At first I had been a little nervous about the possibility that I might goof
  up somehow and lose some data.  But it seems to have worked okay: I did a
  spot check of the result by verifying that my checking account and credit
  card accounts still end up with the same final balance as they did before.
  Also, I typically save any edits to my ledger file in a Subversion
  repository, so I can always get back to a previous version if I need to.

  So now I do have a nice, clean file.

  After I got your message, I did try the "output" command.  I guess I didn't
  understand exactly what it's supposed to be doing, because it didn't quite
  seem to work as I expected.

  If I type:
  :SCRIPT:
ledger -f foo output foo
  :END:
  is it supposed to rewrite foo?  It didn't seem to do that.  Instead, it
  seems to write its output onto stdout.  And not only that, it seems to
  duplicate the last entry in the file.

  For example, if this is my sample file foo:
  :DATA:
2006/01/01 * Xyzzy Mortgage Co.
    Assets:Bank:Checking                  $-1,000.00
    Expenses:Interest:Mortage              $950.00
    Liabilities:Mortgage                     $50.00

Y2005

01/01 * (1830) TPC
    Expenses:Phone                  $100.00
    Assets:Bank:Checking

2/3 (1832) ABC Dept Store
    Expenses:Clothing           $100.00
    Assets:Bank:Checking
  :END:

  Then when I run `ledger -f foo output foo` the output I get is this:
  :OUTPUT:
2006/01/01 * Xyzzy Mortgage Co.
    Assets:Bank:Checking                  $-1,000.00
    Expenses:Interest:Mortage                $950.00
    Liabilities:Mortgage                      $50.00

Y2005

2005/01/01 * (1830) TPC
    Expenses:Phone                           $100.00
    Assets:Bank:Checking

2005/02/03 (1832) ABC Dept Store
    Expenses:Clothing                        $100.00
    Assets:Bank:Checking
2/3 (1832) ABC Dept Store
    Expenses:Clothing           $100.00
    Assets:Bank:Checking
  :END:

  If instead I run `ledger -f foo output foo2`, then I get this:
  :OUTPUT:
Error: Journal does not refer to file ''
  :END:
  So I guess that wan't what I was supposed to do.

  Anyway, this is all just academic, 'cuz as I say I now have a nice, cleaned
  up file, thanks to the "print" command.

  Downloaded and (eventually) compiled the latest version from anonymous CVS.

  Had to update my 'automake' to 1.9 and add "#include <cassert>" to
  datetime.h to get it to make.

  Runs the help screen OK but SEGV's out when attempting to do any useful
  work.

  System is debian stable ('sarge'), gcc 3.3.5 fully upgraded.

  Any clues?

  The emacs report uses byte-positioning to indicate the beginning of entries

  The solution is either to support multi-byte correctly, or to use line
  numbering instead.  levin has offered a patch for this (attached).

    This has already been fixed by A7CA0F5B-1F08-417A-9071-A223601100CA.
  I found a tiny bug in the info documentation for ledger, version
  2.6.0.90, regarding per-unit and complete transaction cost.  There
  seems to be @'s missing (maybe texinfo gobbles up at least on @)

  It says:

  > The `ACCOUNT' may be surrounded by parentheses if it is a virtual
  > transactions, or square brackets if it is a virtual transactions
  > that must balance.  The `AMOUNT' can be followed by a per-unit
  > transaction cost, by specifying ` AMOUNT', or a complete
  > transaction cost with `@ AMOUNT'.  Lastly

  whereas I believe (from reading the source of textual.cc) it should
  be:

  > The `ACCOUNT' may be surrounded by parentheses if it is a virtual
  > transactions, or square brackets if it is a virtual transactions
  > that must balance.  The `AMOUNT' can be followed by a per-unit
  > transaction cost, by specifying `@ AMOUNT', or a complete
