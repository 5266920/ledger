  Another thing that needs to happen is that these assignments are stored

* TODO [#B] Problem with piping input to ledger
  I decided to just go ahead and push my whole ledger file through "print".
  At first I had been a little nervous about the possibility that I might goof
  up somehow and lose some data.  But it seems to have worked okay: I did a
  spot check of the result by verifying that my checking account and credit
  card accounts still end up with the same final balance as they did before.
  Also, I typically save any edits to my ledger file in a Subversion
  repository, so I can always get back to a previous version if I need to.
  
  So now I do have a nice, clean file.
  
  After I got your message, I did try the "output" command.  I guess I didn't
  understand exactly what it's supposed to be doing, because it didn't quite
  seem to work as I expected.
  
  If I type:
  :SCRIPT:
ledger -f foo output foo
  :END:
  is it supposed to rewrite foo?  It didn't seem to do that.  Instead, it
  seems to write its output onto stdout.  And not only that, it seems to
  duplicate the last entry in the file.

  For example, if this is my sample file foo:
  :DATA:
2006/01/01 * Xyzzy Mortgage Co.
    Assets:Bank:Checking                  $-1,000.00
    Expenses:Interest:Mortage              $950.00
    Liabilities:Mortgage                     $50.00

Y2005

01/01 * (1830) TPC
    Expenses:Phone                  $100.00
    Assets:Bank:Checking                            

2/3 (1832) ABC Dept Store
    Expenses:Clothing           $100.00
    Assets:Bank:Checking
  :END:

  Then when I run `ledger -f foo output foo` the output I get is this:
  :OUTPUT:
2006/01/01 * Xyzzy Mortgage Co.
    Assets:Bank:Checking                  $-1,000.00
    Expenses:Interest:Mortage                $950.00
    Liabilities:Mortgage                      $50.00

Y2005

2005/01/01 * (1830) TPC
    Expenses:Phone                           $100.00
    Assets:Bank:Checking                            

2005/02/03 (1832) ABC Dept Store
    Expenses:Clothing                        $100.00
    Assets:Bank:Checking                            
2/3 (1832) ABC Dept Store
    Expenses:Clothing           $100.00
    Assets:Bank:Checking
  :END:

  If instead I run `ledger -f foo output foo2`, then I get this:
  :OUTPUT:
Error: Journal does not refer to file ''
  :END:
  So I guess that wan't what I was supposed to do.

  Anyway, this is all just academic, 'cuz as I say I now have a nice, cleaned
  up file, thanks to the "print" command.

    Until I get some info on this, I'll just have to postpone for 2.7.
  - State "TODO"       [2008-07-16 Wed 03:52] \\
    I don't have a Debian system to try this out with.  Can you give me a login to
    your, rpw, or let me know where I can find an ISO of the exact version you're
    using?
  Downloaded and (eventually) compiled the latest version from anonymous CVS.
  
  Had to update my 'automake' to 1.9 and add "#include <cassert>" to
  datetime.h to get it to make.
  
  Runs the help screen OK but SEGV's out when attempting to do any useful
  work.
  
  System is debian stable ('sarge'), gcc 3.3.5 fully upgraded.
  
  Any clues?

  I am trying to understand the budgeting information in the ledger
  documentation, as well as to understand some basic syntax in my ledger file
  and why it does not appear to be working correctly.  If I have a ledger file
  with:
  :DATA:
~Monthly
   Exp:....   $1000.00
   Exp:....   $500.00
   Exp:....   $250.00
   Exp:....   $1000.00
   Assets
  :END:
  [with real categories blanked out, of course], and Assets at the end, what
  does this imply?  That expenses will be withdrawn/balanced against assets?
  What happens if I have no expenses recorded in my ledger, e.g., what is the
  intended behavior of the budgeting functionality?

  In addition, the following three entries seem to be causing somewhat odd
  behavior:
  :DATA:
2006/05/23
     Assets:Checking:xxxx             $1259.44
     Equity:Opening Balance

2006/05/23
     Assets:Savings:xxxx               $711.31
     Equity:Opening Balance

2006/05/23
     Expenses:Loans:xxxx               $750.00
     Assets:Checking:xxxx
  :END:

  When I perform:
  :OUTPUT:
% ledger -f ~/ledger.txt -MAs bal ^expenses
              $375.00  Expenses:Loans
              $750.00    xxxx
--------------------
              $375.00
  :END:
  and these are the only three entries in the ledger file, did I miss
  something as far as the intended behavior?  Is there a bug somewhere in my
  libgmp, etc?

  I'm on Mac OS X 10.4 on an Intel machine.

* TODO [#B] Bug in ledger equity output
  Seeing as how I've reached the end of my financial year my thoughts turned
  to how to 'close the books'.

  I have the following as part of my account tree:
  :DATA:
Assets:Super:ARF
Assets:Super:CSS
Assets:Super:CSS:Contributions
  :END:

  The ledger 'balance' report correctly shows `Contributions` to be a child of
  `Assets:Super:CSS`:
  :OUTPUT:
$ ledger -l 'd<=[30/06/2006]' -w -s bal ^Assets:Super
         $171,819.90  Assets:Super
          $12,777.87    ARF
         $159,042.03    CSS
           $3,861.00      Contributions
--------------------
         $171,819.90
  :END:

  However the ledger `equity` report formats `Contributions` as a new
  top-level account:
  :OUTPUT:
$ ledger -l 'd<=[30/06/2006]' -w equity ^Assets:Super

14/07/2006 Opening Balances
    Assets:Super:ARF                      $12,777.87
    Assets:Super:CSS                     $155,181.03
    Contributions                          $3,861.00
                                        $-171,819.90
  :END:

  Whilst its no great issue to manually edit the report (have to change the
  date anyway) its slightly annoying.

  Use the following ledger data
  :DATA:
2004/05/01 * Checking balance
  Assets:Bank:Checking        1000.00
  Equity:Opening Balances
  :END:

  With cursor on the beginning of the second line, eval
  `(ledger-context-at-point)`, which returns:
  :OUTPUT:
(acct-transaction account ((indent "  " 31) (account "Assets:Bank:Checking        1000.00" 33)))
  :END:
  It is not correct, since 1000.00 ought to be amount.

  ledger-context-at-point also fails to parse amount with ',' in it, such as:
  :DATA:

  - State "DONE"       [2008-08-25 Mon 23:54] \\
    This has been implemented.
  The emacs report uses byte-positioning to indicate the beginning of entries
  and transactions.  This breaks with multi-byte files.

  The release (2.6.0.90) doesn't seem to properly parse dates.  The svn
  version (rev. 1048) works fine for full dates (yyyy/mm/dd) with the -b -e
  params but nothing else works.  For example in the following only the last
  one works:
  :SCRIPT:
ledger -f my.ledger -b mar -e apr print
ledger -f my.ledger -b 03/01 -e -04/01 apr print
ledger -f my.ledger -b 03/01 -e 04/01 print
ledger -f my.ledger -b 08/03/01 -e 08/04/01 print
ledger -f my.ledger -b 2008/03/01 -e 2008/04/01 print
  :END:
  The -p param doesn't seem to work at all.

    Simon, have you tried this with 2.6.1-svn?  I believe this is something I
    fixed.
  Unlike 2.5, 2.6 considers an account name followed by whitespace to be
  different from one without (when no amount is specified).

    This is a known bug that was fixed in 2.6.  If you need a back-patch for
    2.4.1, please let me know.
  We have ledger-2.4 in the ports, but it segfaults on freebsd-8 (the current
  dev version of the OS).  The backtrace is incoherent, because the libs are
  stripped and we have no symbols.  Anyway, a sane person would want a more
  recent ledger.  The tarball exhibits the exact same problem as the one from
  SVN:

  I know C and i can do some gdb(1), but i don't have the C++ knowledge to
  even fix this one.  It looks not all that complicated.  Maybe a little patch
  could help the C++ compiler to figure out the type inference.

  I used emacs for quite some time, but got annoyed with its ancient lisp.  So
  using the common lisp version is currently not an option for me, and without
  emacs one has to type way to much for some little reports.  Could you please
  bring the C++ version into a usable state again?  perhaps it's not that much
  work?

  :OUTPUT:
$ ledger entry 2008/07/18 "Pei Wei" food 20 checking

2008/07/18 Pei Wei
    Expenses:Food:Out                        $ 20.00

$ ledger entry 2008/07/18 "Foo Bar" food 20 checking

2008/07/18 Foo Bar
    Expenses:Food                            $ 20.00
    Equity
  :END:

  The first command proves that ledger understands I have an `Assets:Checking`
  account.  That's because I already have entries for `Pei Wei`.

  If I enter a description that doesn't match a previous entry, it doesn't
  match `checking` to `Assets:Checking`.

  I am using transactions between accounts with different base commodities in
  gnucash.  Ledger reports a segfault when reading the gnucash file and using
  the command `print`.

    This is not an error because:
    
    1. specifying no amount is the same as specifying an uncommoditized zero.
    2. the second line will "auto-balance" with the first line.
    3. the third line simply is a no-op, which I allow for the sake of script
       writers.
    
    There could be a warning for something like this, but then that's the
    danger of using () around an account name: you are explicitly stating you
    do not wish the transaction to be balanced.

    However, even though I do not receive parse errors any longer, the
    price-db command does not work the way I expect it to. When I issue a
    'bal' option, ledger still outputs the values in their commodity rather
    than the dollar amount, so even though I am not receiving an error, it
    still does not seem to work for me.
  My prices.db file looks like: 
  :DATA:
p 2007/01/14 02:18:01 WMCVX $5.04 
p 2007/01/14 02:18:02 WMICX $6.65
  :END:
  Notice there is no carriage return after the second line and that the file
  begins on line 1.
  
  When I run 'ledger --price-db prices.db bal' I get the following: 
  :OUTPUT:
Error: prices.db, line 2: Failed to parse dateP 
Error: Errors parsing file 'life/finances/ledger/prices.db' 
  :END:

  If I have a carriage return on the second line, I get errors for both line 2
  and line 3. If i have one entry on a single line, I get an error for line 2.
  
  Any ideas? 
  
  Also, I would like to get the prices.db perl script working to automatically
  grab the values from Fidelity, but I have not been able to do anything
  beyond installing the appropriate perl modules. If there are any
  instructions for this usage, I would appreciate it.
