* TODO Don't use -s for bal the way it's used now
* DONE If an exception occurs while --verify --verbose is on, it shows lots and lots of leaked memory
* DONE Get 'make distcheck' working again with Ledger 2.7
* DONE Using my PowerPC, build a universal Ledger binary for OS X Leopard
* DONE Add a way for building in any directory (other than ~/Products) in acprep
* DONE Verify: make fullcheck
* DONE Verify: make dist
* DONE Verify: make distcheck
* DONE Create regression tests for all the closed 2.6.1 bugs
* DONE This is a test that 'make check' would run after running the UnitTests.
* CANCELLED Delete all the "help" pages from the Ledger Trac
* DONE Formalize tagging
  - Search with "account / tags", similar to "account -- payee".
  - Tagging is any note with :tag: in it.
  - Entries now need notes.
* DONE Post to the Ledger forums about Ledger's new direction
* DONE Revise the way that error contexts are passed up
* DONE Special care needs to be taken that legitimate uses of exceptions are not too expensive.
* DONE Split binary.cc into journal-specific and generic, and put the generic one in libamounts
* DONE 2.x value expression syntax must be restored
  The only way this is going to really be possible is with a battery of unit tests.

  "AutoOpenBalance" from Martin Blais <blais@furius.ca>

  This means getting the unit tests running again.

* DONE Restore deleted directories from src/ledger/lib
* TODO There are a few thorny issues remaining with the binary cache
  1. What happens to value expressions that have been compiled?  The FUNCTION
     operand must remember the name of the function it was compiled to; but
     even then, how can I recompile and maintain the same environment as the
     original point of definition?

  2. Base commodities no longer exist in their own data structure, but use
     shared_ptr to track multiple accesses.  How to write out this unwritten
     structure?
